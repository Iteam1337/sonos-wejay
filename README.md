# Sonos Wejay

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Iteam1337/sonos-wejay.svg?token=pRHtrm4YwVYpN8sqXadx&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Iteam1337/sonos-wejay)

Wejay is a music collaboration bot for Slack that can be used to add music to a local Sonos system. It needs to be started on the same network as your Sonos system in order to communicate with the speakers.

## Get started

### Prerequisites

Start by creating a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. This is for the Spotify search feature and to allow the bot to interact with Slack. It should contain

```
SPOTIFY_ID=spotify-token-here
SPOTIFY_SECRET=spotify-secret-here
SLACK_TOKEN=slack-token-here
WEJAY_IP=ip-of-the-speaker
```

Spotify token/secret can be generated by creating an app at https://developer.spotify.com/. Slack token can be found after adding the bot to your Slack below. `WEJAY_IP` is found in "About My Sonos System" of the Sonos Controller app.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Iteam1337/sonos-wejay.git
$ cd sonos-wejay
$ npm install
$ npm build && npm run dev
```

This will compile the Reason code and start up the Express app.

## Testing it out

1. The easiest way to start testing is using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). After you've installed `ngrok`, open another terminal and run `ngrok http 3000`. This will create a tunnel to you local environment.
2. Go to https://api.slack.com/apps and create a new app
3. Inside _OAuth & Permissions_ you'll find "Bot User OAuth Access Token" which is the token that should be added in your `.env` above.
4. Go to _Interactive Components_ and enable it. In the request url enter one of the urls provided by `ngrok` (http or https) and the route `/action`, i.e. https://127.0.0.1/action
5. Also on _Interactive Components_ add a action. Give it the name "Queue track" and description and callback id "queue"
6. Go to _Event Subscriptions_ and enable it. In the request url use the same url as above but use the route `/event`
7. Also on _Event Subscriptions_ add a "Bot User Event". The best one is `message.im`, which means you can send commands to the bot in private messages
8. You should be able to send some commands to the bot in Slack now, try sending `help` to see all available commands

### Copy and paste from Spotify

You can also select a couple of tracks in Spotify, press `cmd+c` (Mac) / `ctrl+c` (Windows), paste the copied information to the Wejay bot and send the message. Wejay will add all of your tracks at the end of the queue! :tada:

## Database

Some of the commands, like `blame` and `toplist` requires that you have a MySQL database that the service can access. We've included a `docker-compose.yml` that you can use to spin up a database.
